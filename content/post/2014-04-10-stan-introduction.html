<h2>시작하며</h2>
<p>Bayesian inference using Gibbs sampling:BUGS는 베이즈 추정을 계산기 통계학적으로 수행하는 방법. “계산기 통계학적으로”라는 것은 복잡하고 어려운 함수기술에서 생략할 수 있는 부분은 생략해서 MCMC/Gibbs sampling으로 대체한다는 의미로 생각해도 좋음. 베이즈 추정을 하기 위해 우도 함수 등을 미리 구해 빡시게 코딩하는 것보다는 BUGS(WinBUGS, OpenBUGS, JAGS)등을 이용해 모델의 기술하고 실행한 후 결과를 확인하는 것이 편리. 그렇다고 해도 계산 시간이 오래 걸린다는 문제점은 남아 있음. 여기서는 Stan이라는 최근 많이 사용되는(것 같은?) 소프트웨어를 R에서 사용하는 방법에 대해 메모.</p>

<h2>Stan의 개요</h2>
<p>Stan의 홈페이지는 <a href="http://mc-stan.org/%5D">여기</a>.</p>
<p>Stan의 개요에 대해서는 <a href="http://www.dynacom.co.jp/tech/tech_column/tech013.html">이곳</a>과 <a href="http://tjo.hatenablog.com/entry/2014/03/25/194605">이곳</a>(일본어)에서 번역 발췌.</p>
<p>모델의 기술방법에 약간의 차이가 있지만, BUGS와 같이 우선 모델을 기술. Stan은 기술된 모델을 일단 C++ 언어로 변환하여 컴파일하는 흐름. C++로 컴파일함으로 인해 고속처리를 기대할 수 있고 일단 컴파일된 모듈을 다른 데이터에도 이용할 수 있게 됨. BUGS에서는 별도의 데이터를 이용하기 위해서는 모델의 확인 -&gt; 데이터 지정 -&gt; 초기화 -&gt; 컴파일의 과정을 전부 다시 해야함. stan을 이용하면 이 과정이 생략되기 때문에 전체 실행 과정의 고속화를 꾀할 수 있음.</p>
<p>또한, C++ 이라는 언어의 특성상 모델의 기술이 엄격하게 되어 데이터의 형태 (int, real) 및 변수가 가질 수 있는 범위를 선언할 수 있게 됨. BUGS에서는 왜 샘플링 에러가 발생했는지 등에 대해 어림짐작으로 대응해야 하기 때문에 경험이 중요했음. 이러한 것들이 구체적으로 지적되기 때문에 디버깅이 편리해짐.</p>
<p>Stan에서 사용하는 난수 샘플링방법은 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_Monte_Carlo">Hamiltonian Monte Carlo Method</a>를 채용하여 수렴의 속도 및 안정성도 BUGS에 비해 향상됨.</p>

#&gt; Samples were drawn using NUTS(diag_e) at Sun Jul  8 16:17:59 2018.
#&gt; For each parameter, n_eff is a crude measure of effective sample size,
#&gt; and Rhat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at
